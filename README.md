# Leukemia Gene Expression Classification using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying different types of leukemia samples based on gene expression profiles using multiple machine learning models. The dataset used comes from the Curated Microarray Database (CuMiDa), specifically the Leukemia Gene Expression dataset. The primary objective is to explore the effectiveness of various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and XGBoost, and compare their performance in predicting cancer types from microarray data.

The work includes:

Preprocessing and scaling high-dimensional microarray data.

Applying multiple ML models for classification.

Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.

Visualizing gene expression patterns and sample distributions.

# ðŸ“Š About the Dataset
The Curated Microarray Database (CuMiDa) is a collection of 78 carefully selected cancer microarray datasets curated from over 30,000 studies available on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). This database is specifically designed for machine learning applications in cancer research.

# Key features of CuMiDa:

Manually curated datasets with quality control steps applied.

Homogeneous preprocessing, including removal of unwanted probes, background correction, and normalization.

Designed to provide reliable data for computational research.

Includes benchmark results using 3-fold cross-validation, PCA, and t-SNE projections.

Leukemia_GSE9476.csv contains:

64 samples

22,285 gene expression features

5 classes: Bone_Marrow_CD34, Bone_Marrow, AML, PB, PBSC_CD34

# ðŸ“œ About
Here we present the Curated Microarray Database (CuMiDa), a repository containing 78 handpicked cancer microarray datasets, extensively curated from 30,000 studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), solely for machine learning. The aim of CuMiDa is to offer homogeneous and state-of-the-art biological preprocessing of these datasets, together with numerous 3-fold cross-validation benchmark results to propel machine learning studies focused on cancer research. The database makes available various download options to be employed by other programs, as well as PCA and t-SNE results. CuMiDa stands out from existing databases by offering newer datasets, manually and carefully curatedâ€”from sample quality checks and removal of unwanted probes to background correction and normalizationâ€”creating a more reliable source of data for computational research.
