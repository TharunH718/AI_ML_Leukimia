# Leukemia Gene Expression Classification using Machine Learning
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying different types of leukemia samples based on gene expression profiles using multiple machine learning models. The dataset used comes from the Curated Microarray Database (CuMiDa), specifically the Leukemia Gene Expression dataset. The primary objective is to explore the effectiveness of various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and XGBoost, and compare their performance in predicting cancer types from microarray data.

The work includes:

Preprocessing and scaling high-dimensional microarray data.

Applying multiple ML models for classification.

Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.

Visualizing gene expression patterns and sample distributions.
